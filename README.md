# rockPaperScissorsGame

I developed this application that allowed players to play the classic game of 'Rock Paper Scissors'. 

The purpose of this application was to improve my ability to work with animations and Javascript Dom Manipulation. Examples of the animations include: when the button is pressed the hand will change shape, and shake (as if a person was rolling a dice). 

The technologies used are: 

-Javascript
-HTML
-CSS
